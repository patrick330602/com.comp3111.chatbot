The objective of this course is to equip our next generation leaders in different disciplines with enhanced environmental awareness and knowledge of tools and solutions to environmental issues. They will therefore be able to make responsible decisions and actions, with due consideration of the environment and sustainability. Each lesson is divided into two parts. The first part is the introduction and discussion of essential concepts and environmental issues and debates of these issues and will be delivered and guided by the instructor. The second part involves presentations of projects, focus studies, or service learning activities of new, emerging environmental issues selected by student groups, with emphases on solutions to the issues."

The course consists of two interrelated parts: hydrology and hydraulics. Hydrology covers various processes of water cycle (including precipitation, infiltration, rainfall-runoff modeling, and flow routings) that produce loads on hydrosystems. Hydraulics, on the other hand, applies fluid mechanics principles to the design and analysis the capacity of hydrosystems infrastructures such as pipe networks and channel networks as well as hydraulic machinery."

Emphasis will be placed on the “practical exercise” for the simulation of future climate in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases using the web-based global climate model (EdGCM) with a user-friendly interface that can be run on laptop or desktop computer. Through this practice, students will learn full scientific processes related to climate modeling such as experimental design, running simulation, data analysis, and interpretation of results. On this foundation, the latter half of the course will be shifted to the topics for the identification and assessment of the risks from climate extremes. Eventually, students will have familiarity with climate modeling techniques and better sense to grapple with a myriad of complex climate issues."

The course aims to provide students with the ability to define environmental systems, evaluate alternatives for making optimal decisions, and develop sustainable solutions. Simple to complex case studies are used to present concepts of environmental modeling and single-objective optimization to identify best strategies for environmental quality control. Concepts of multi-objective optimization and Pareto efficiency are also presented for solving problems with conflicting economic and environmental goals. These key concepts are applied to a selection of environmental problems, including problems of water and air quality, solid waste management, and climate change."

This course exposes students to both the theory and hands-on experience of this new technology. The course will cover the following topics. (1) Basic concepts of Cloud Computing and production Cloud services; (2) MapReduce - the de facto datacenter-scale programming abstraction - and its open source implementation of Hadoop. (3) Apache Spark - a new generation parallel processing framework - and its infrastructure, programming model, cluster deployment, tuning and debugging, as well as a number of specialized data processing systems built on top of Spark. By walking through a number of hands-on labs and assignments, students are expected to gain first-hand experience programming on real world clusters in production datacenters."

The basic framework will be the \"IS-LM\" equilibrium method, in which we analyze the major markets which affect the macroeconomy - labor, output, money and foreign exchange markets by studying positions of general equilibrium in them. This framework will be used to analyze fiscal and monetary policies.  This is a core course for MBA."

Examples from a variety of Electronic and Computer Engineering disciplines will be given to illustrate the modeling process. Then, basic tools needed for analyzing the behavior of dynamical systems will be presented. Finally, techniques for controlling their behavior will be introduced. Throughout the course, laboratory experiments demonstrating the use of these analysis/design tools will be included."

Many people intend to consume in a sustainable manner, but with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate the ingredients hidden in everyday products and explore features that make them unsustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. The course will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption and give students opportunities (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to explore ways in which smart consumption can be promoted and in which consumer-felt responsibility for sustainability can be increased."

Emphasis will be placed on the “practical exercise” for the simulation of future climate in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases using the web-based global climate model (EdGCM) with a user-friendly interface that can be run on laptop or desktop computer. Through this practice, students will learn full scientific processes related to climate modeling such as experimental design, running simulation, data analysis, and interpretation of results. On this foundation, the latter half of the course will be shifted to the topics for the identification and assessment of the risks from climate extremes. Eventually, students will have familiarity with climate modeling techniques and better sense to grapple with a myriad of complex climate issues."

Contemporary dance is thus not only about art making but also exploring personal and social meanings. Through examining a range of texts and videos from different parts of the world at lectures, students will learn to appreciate different ways in which significant practitioners make dances. They will also  be introduced  to the historical, social or political contexts, and the ideas that inform these practices. In practice sessions, a range of physical, experiential approaches will be introduced to help students create with movement. Students interested in furthering the artistic skills and gaining hands-on experience with this art form may enroll in a separate non-credit co-curricular course."

Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality."

Mencius and Aristotle were contemporaries. Mencius is an argumentative yet ethical thinker; the book of Mencius provides us with logical and persuasive debates on virtues and human nature. For both Aristotle and Mencius, the logic of arguments and the art of rhetoric are the chief weapons in the service of truth. In this course, we explore: (a) the basic concepts of logical thinking and the art of rhetoric, and (b) the cultural and philosophical values exhibited and implicit in Mencius and Aristotle's logical works."

The sustainability of local cultures has become a major concern. Culture is an important component of sustainable development, as it refers to how we understand and appreciate natural resources and each other. Cultural sustainability requires the recognition of indigenous cultural values and standards, as well as equal rights of the respective communities in policy planning and decision-making, and the engagement of the local community and members of the public. This course adopts an interdisciplinary approach to explore the concept, possibilities, and limits of cultural sustainability. Students are required to conduct field research projects in the Pearl River Delta region, in which they will meet the local residents and have personal fieldwork experience through interviewing and participant observation."

In the past, Southwest China, particularly Yunnan, has been conceptualised as an area both remote from the Chinese political centre and isolated from the outside world, but an analysis of historical data concerning the formation of kingdoms and polities, trade routes, and the movement of people offers a different interpretation. It demonstrates that far from being isolated, the two areas overlap, and in reality are bonded by political, cultural and ethnic ties. Analysis of historical data provides a vibrant perspective for understanding Southwest China, not as an area at the margins of Chinese and SEA history, but as a vital link in a chain that connects SEA with the worlds of China and Tibet. Emphasis on interconnection highlights a fundamental relationship between both regions, and offers students a framework for understanding the increased presence of China in mainland SEA in recent years."

Secondly, it discusses the theoretical framework of behavioral finance in asset allocation in terms of the prospect theory, SP/A theory, behavioral portfolio theory and goals-based strategy. Next, it examines the issues of risk profiling and investor characterization. Then, it explains the major behavioral biases possibly committed by wealth management and private banking clients and the diagnostic tests to identify them. Last but not least, it explores the possible applications of behavioral finance concepts in wealth management and private banking. The course content lays a good foundation to understand the CFA examination curriculum in behavioral finance."

                "description": "This course aims to help the participants understand a number of special topics in financial markets and bank intermediation. The first topic discusses the financial system, different types of financial markets and rationale for bank intermediation. The underlying reasons for bank intermediation include payment mechanism, liquidity provision, maturity and denomination transformation, risk transformation, economy of scale and asymmetric information. The next topic examines financial market microstructure including trading, traders and trade facilitators, different trading systems, types of orders, block trades and odd lots, regulated short selling, security margin trading, liquidity, and impacts of algorithmic trading and FinTech. The first two topics lay a good foundation to understand the CFA examination Level 1 curriculum in Market Organization and Structure (Equity). The third topic is related to recent cases of financial shenanigans in financial markets in terms of accounting tricks and financial gimmicks. These tricks and gimmicks are illustrated through a number of case studies. The final topic examines the issue of renminbi internationalization. Participants will join forces to understand this last topic through their own research, presentations and reports."

Financing is an important decision factor determining returns for developers and investors in real estate. For banks, real estate financing is an important business given the relatively large size of the industry. This course focuses on how real estate financing is undertaken and the key considerations for the borrower and the lender. This is achieved through a master case study which runs through the duration of the course and evolves as different aspects of real estate financing are discussed. The course will focus on the key steps in a transaction life-cycle and require participants to prepare basic cashflow models, approval memos and termsheets including presenting them. Some additional case studies around hedging will cover specific considerations around cross border real estate investments which is a big focus for global real estate investors."

Students learn how to adapt and apply their English language abilities to real-world assignments within their business major and, after graduation, to career tasks and opportunities. Positioned toward the latter portion of a student’s undergraduate business education, the course prepares students to succeed in their remaining university assignments (such as research tools, written tests, presentations, interviews, meetings, collaborative assignments, interpersonal communication and so forth) as well as the communication challenges they can expect in their careers. For students in their third or fourth year of study who have this course as a program requirement."

In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills.

It provides students with a solid framework and hands-on practice to communicate persuasively and professionally in business settings. In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills. For students who have this course as a program requirement."

The course is restricted to students with non‐Chinese language backgrounds. Instructors’ approval is required for students with Chinese backgrounds who are from international schools of Hong Kong, China Mainland and other Asian countries, also for overseas students with either Mandarin or Cantonese language backgrounds. For students without prerequisite but with prior Chinese learning experience of approximately 50 hours may seek instructors’ approval to enroll in the course."

How do they extract maximum value from the customer relationship? This course focuses on the new marketing tools and techniques—targeted marketing, databases, data mining and modeling, CRM, testing and measurement, and integrated marketing communications—that businesses use to attract the most productive new prospects, convert them to buyers, and gain their loyalty over the long term. This kind of marketing is targeted, measurable and ROI-driven. With these approaches, marketing can be fully accountable to shareholders and stakeholders. Strategies covered in this course include: data capture and data modeling, segmentation by customer value and behavior, buying process analysis, direct response communications, customer contact management, customer experience marketing, and marketing metrics and testing. This course introduces the business, decision-making, strategic, tactical and operational skills essential to managing the customer base as an asset."

This course is to crystallize some concepts and ideas put forth in \"The Art of War\" into a few business strategic principles and an innovative framework of 4Stop so that these can be more easily understood and applied."

As a starting point, we first explore the equilibrium concepts (Bayesian Nash Equilibrium and Perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium) adopted in this class of games and develop relevant theories. Next, we shall explore the application of incomplete information games including auction games, job market signaling games, capital financing etc.. To enroll this course, students are expected to have solid knowledge in game theory, basic probability theory and calculus. Students should seek instructor’s approval to take this course."

With constant expansion of aerospace industry driven by economic development, universities are required to better equip the students with knowledge and skills in design. The essence of design activities is to apply a variety of methods in an integrated manner, in order to produce design solutions which meet a set of objectives and constraints from technical, commercial, and social perspectives. This also need to be achieved in a schedule demanded by the customer, and within the specified budget, in order to maintain competitiveness against products from competitors. In this course, a set of advanced topics will be provided which complement what students would typically learn during studies at the undergraduate level. Students will be exposed to (1) principles, workflows and methods in multidisciplinary aircraft design practice, (2) concepts of some advanced engineering optimization methods and strategies, (3) some case studies used in industry design office or joint university-industry effort in research activities. At the end of the course, students will be able to formulate a conceptual aircraft optimization problem, build a variety of simulation models of various fidelity, and apply multi-objective optimization methods to solving the complex simulation-based design optimization problems."

As an experiential course, a number of labs have been prepared with a different focus on orbits dynamics, analysis of control and thermal subsystems. Every student should finish fundamental labs (~2 weeks each) individually, and organize a group, select and complete two advanced lab topics (~3 weeks each). The course shall offer students with both hands-on experience software simulation and hardware implementation. The topics in this course are introduced with mathematical derivations and case studies. After taking this course, we hope students will understand the fundamentals of satellite engineering and grasp the usage of common engineering design tools, such as MATLAB Aerospace blockset and CubeSat IMU hardware; and therefore gain the capability to attend astronautics related international competitions, such as GTOC in the near future."

Students with more advanced physics background should consider taking PHYS 1312. PHYS 1112 employs a calculus-based approach. Students without knowledge of calculus should take PHYS 1111 instead. Key topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics. For students under the 4-year degree only. Students without the physics prerequisite but have taken PHYS 1001 or equivalent, and/or without the mathematics prerequisite but have taken MATH 1012/ MATH 1013/ MATH 1020/ MATH 1023 or equivalent may seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in the course."

Students are expected to develop a study and fabrication plan at the start of the course. Under the supervision of the course instructor, students will design, build or fabricate the needed parts and assemble the parts to produce functional prototypes or units to demonstrate the proposed physical laws in the areas related to physics, e.g. mechanics, electronics, waves (optics or sound), electromagnetism, or model physics. By the end of the course, students are required to write a final report for the project and perform an oral presentation. The project may be extended for a second term for extra credits subject to satisfactory performance and project report. Students may also repeat the course for credits if different topics are taken. For PHYS students with instructor's approval only."

                "description": "This course presents and exemplifies three major traditions of ethical thought in East and West moral philosophy - namely utilitarianism, principle-based ethics and virtue-based ethics. Employing guest speakers, lectures, cases, contemporary readings, role-plays, fieldwork, reflective student writing, and discussion groups, the course engages students in a serious consideration of their own ethical standards as applied to their present academic environment and their future careers. Students come to understand through this course that while an ethical dilemma may be viewed in various ways depending on one's guiding assumptions, a decision and course of action nevertheless must be chosen in harmony with one's own moral convictions. For Business students only."

Manager employee interactions have largely replaced comprehensive organizational career management systems as the primary building block of learning and professional growth. However, managers often lack the skills to build collaborative relationships that facilitate the learning, performance and development of their people. Managers skill in empowering and coaching employees affects performance, morale and attrition. Approximately half the course will be an introduction to theories, models and tools of people development. The rest of the course will be devoted to learning and practicing applied coaching skills that students can take back to their jobs to enhance their individual growth and organizational success.

A review on the economic aspects in the aerospace sector is first given. This is followed by market analysis methods, analysis of development cost of new technologies and its impact on aircraft project. Development schedule, the unit cost of aircraft, and life cycle cost of aircraft programs are also discussed. From airlines’ perspective, the concept and methods of operating cost are described, along with discussions on differentiation factors between low cost and major airlines. Other areas covered include cost estimation relations, economic implications of environmental impact, and engine program cost. Value driven design and design for economics is given in the last few lectures to illustrate that how economic analysis methods can be used in aircraft design process to provide added value. Some brief discussions on UAV costing is also given."

The course starts by reviewing the formation of a vibrant market economy in China from 1700 onward and introduce progress made in the studies of Chinese economic history. This historical background is important to view the socio-economic characteristics of the pre-1949 Chinese society and their relevance to modern economic growth. This course also exposes the students to the basic concepts and analytic tools in political economy such as market economy, the state, conflict of interests, correlation and causality, and selection bias. This illustrates the importance of causal explanations in social scientific inquiry and encourages students to compare it with similar causal reasoning in science and engineering."

For these and other topics, the class presents examples of classic as well recent studies that make exemplary use of data and methods, and which have advanced our understanding of the relevant phenomena. The class will also introduce the major sources of data for quantitative social analysis, with an emphasis on ones that are publicly available. Along the way, students will learn about the differences between the concerns, paradigms, and methodologies of the major social science disciplines. Strengths and limitations of quantitative techniques for the study of social phenomenon will be discussed, as will the relationship of quantitative approaches to other methodologies."

In order to master this sociological outlook, the course shall examine a number of topics central to our lives from the point of view of sociological perspectives and methods. These topics will include: culture, deviance, inequality, religion, education, social change and development, gender, intimate relations and the family, and power and politics."

The Party-state system first emerged in the beginning of the 20th century in Russia after the 1917 October Revolution, then inspired parallel political developments in China during the 1920-40s, in Germany during the 1930-40s, and eventually spread to more Central-East European and Asian countries. Special emphasis will be placed on post-1976 China for three reasons basically: the Party-state system therein has been displaying some unique novelties despite the noticeable institutional and structural continuity; the system has been appearing more attractive to some parts of the world community amid the recent economic and financial crises affecting numerous countries; and the system has been exercising growing weight upon the lives and future directions of the Hong Kong population and politics."

How can ethnic minorities be better served in educational systems? What should be the role of the humanities and creativity in education? How are administrative principles of audit culture, managerialism and performance targets shaping educational institutions? To answer these questions, students will be encouraged to reflect upon their own educational experiences, as well as examine contemporary debates about education at all levels in Hong Kong, and across cultures."

It then examines how the rules governing economic activities have been redefined in major economic sectors since 1978. It also highlights the main features of the new, capitalistic economy and reflects on the issues and challenges that have emerged during the transformation of the economy."

Last year alone saw $5 billion in machine learning (ML) venture investment. In this experiential learning course, students will work on a challenge faced by an executive recruitment firm of how to plan for AI technology adoption for process automation. To solve this problem, students will learn about the recruitment industry, recruitment processes, object-oriented analysis, AI with supervised learning, AI Chatbot and software project planning. The final deliverable is a presentation of recommended process automation strategies and investment plan to a panel of external judges and corporate sponsors, namely Barons, IBM and Harman. Enrollment in the project course requires approval of the course instructor."

Building on the understanding of\nprobability and random samples, the course teaches three important statistical tools:\nestimation, hypothesis test and regression. Excel Data Analysis ToolPak will be taught and used in class. However, understanding the core statistical concept makes adapting to other tools easy. The focus of this course is application and real world skill, however a minimal amount of mathematics will be needed to understand the concept and theory."

Some specific topics for discussion include how translations of Western literature impacted Chinese literature and culture and how Western canons exerted influence and were reinterpreted in China. Also on the agenda will be discussions of the translation and appropriation of Chinese culture in the Western context. Students will be guided to engage in critical thinking on the literary and cultural issues of (un)translatability and (in)communicability in the present age of globalization and cultural hybridity."

It addresses questions such as what factors help explain why some countries are rich and others poor and whether economic policies can affect these factors. We will study key aspects of life for poor households in the developing world, such as inequality, gender and the intra-household division of resources, education, health, savings and credit, institutions and globalization. Students will also study recent research in the field and examine empirical evidence on these topics."
